# California Housing Clustering Model

This project aims to cluster the California Housing dataset into economic regions based on the median income. The K-means algorithm has been utilized for this purpose, revealing noticeable differences between the identified economic regions in terms of median house value and median income.

## Data Source
The California Housing dataset is used in this project, providing various features such as median income, median house value, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and latitude/longitude. The dataset is widely used for exploring and developing machine learning models for the prediction of house prices.

## Methodology
The project employs the K-means clustering algorithm, a widely used unsupervised machine learning technique. By considering the 'median_income' feature, the data points are clustered into distinct economic regions based on similarity in this aspect. The identified regions provide insights into the economic landscape of California, showcasing the varying distributions of housing prices and incomes.

## Results
The clustering analysis indicates distinct economic regions within California. The differences in median house value and median income across these regions are notable, highlighting the socioeconomic variations within the state. These insights can aid policymakers, urban planners, and real estate professionals in understanding the diversity of California's housing market and its economic landscape.

## Usage
Feel free to use the provided code for clustering the California Housing dataset based on median income. You can modify the code for experimentation and further analysis. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed before running the code.

## Future Work
This project serves as a foundational exploration of the California Housing dataset. Future work could involve more advanced clustering techniques, the incorporation of additional features, and the development of predictive models for housing prices. Additionally, incorporating visualizations and interactive tools could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset and its implications for the state's economy and housing market.
